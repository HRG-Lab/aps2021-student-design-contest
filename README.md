# 2021 IEEE APS/URSI Student Design Contest

This repository contains the Huff Research Group's submission to the [2021 APS Student Design Contest](https://www.ieeeaps.org/education/student-design-contest), Project Artemis. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a software-defined radio (SDR) phased array architecture that performs direction of arrival (DoA) and beamforming (BF). The system will be composed of the KerberosSDR, a 4-channel coherent radio, and use a modified version of the KerberosSDR demo software to perform MUSIC spectral estimation. The focus will be building an educational toolkit that can be utilized to teach beamforming and DoA, comparing analog and digital techniques as well as hybrid analog-digital architectures.
