# 2020 IEEE APS/URSI Student Design Contest

This subdirectory contains the submission to the [2021 APS Student Design Contest](https://www.ieeeaps.org/education/student-design-contest). The goal of this project is to demonstrate a hybrid analog-digital beamforming system that performs DoA and beamforming based on the KerberosSDR and GNURadio. The focus will be building an educational toolkit that can be utilized to teach beamforming and DoA, comparing analog and digital techniques as well as hybrid architectures.

## Proposal Write-up

By December 31, 2021, we will submit a 4-page proposal of the architecture.

## GNURadio Codebase

## Jupyter Teaching Notebooks

## Hardware Architecture
